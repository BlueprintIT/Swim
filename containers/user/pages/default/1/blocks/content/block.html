<h2>Improving the knowledge and skills of your work force through effective training &amp; knowledge transfer</h2>
<p>Running successful projects relies on having a work force with competence in relevant areas.
	This competence translates, in real terms, to having appropriate knowledge, skills and attitude
  towards the work at hand. Effective training is not just about good presentation skills, but also
  relies on solid practical, as well as theoretical, background. People also learn far more effectively if they are
  involved with the training and interact not only with the course tutor, but also with the other attendees. Creating
  the correct training 'attitude' is paramount to effective learning through presentations and interactive workshops.</p>
